# Fourier_Drawing
Draws a curve using two Discrete Fourier Transforms.

You need a txt file with discrete coordinates for your curve.

You may need to modify the signals(inputs) a bit. Making them larger or moving them to left or right are acceptable operations. Values to be modified are x_signal and y_signal.
