Draws Lissajous Figures in Pygame

Lissajous figures, also known as Lissajous curves or Bowditch curves, are captivating and aesthetically pleasing mathematical patterns that result from the interaction of simple harmonic motions.

To create a Lissajous figure, one needs two simple harmonic oscillations, typically represented by the following equations:

x(t) = A * sin(a * t + δ)
y(t) = B * sin(b * t)

In this simulation, A = B and δ = 0.

You can run the code directly. Make sure you have pygame installed.
