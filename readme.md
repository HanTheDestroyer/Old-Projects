# Han's Learning Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of old projects that I created as I learned various concepts and techniques in programming, mathematics, and computer science. Each folder represents a different project where I explored topics ranging from fractals to simulations, graphical patterns, and more. These projects reflect my learning journey and the experiments I conducted along the way.

## Projects

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main language for implementation.
- **ModernGL**: Used for OpenGL graphics and rendering.
- **NumPy** & **CuPy**: For numerical computations and array handling.
- **Mathematical Algorithms**: Used in various projects (e.g., fractals, recursive algorithms, simulations).

## About These Projects

These are early-stage experiments, and many of them are incomplete or rough around the edges. However, they represent important steps in my understanding of graphics, mathematics, and computational thinking.

Feel free to browse through them, learn from them, or use them as a base to further build upon.
